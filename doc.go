/*
	Goinsta is unofficial API of Instagram for Golang.
	This library provides private API methods.

	We changed the API for the comfort of the user.
	The new API is object-oriented making the programming bot task less repetitive.

	Currently the API is very complete (we did it in a week xd).
	If you see that Goinsta needs any method or any new feature you are free to open
	an issue in github.com/ahmdrz/goinsta we will work to solve your issue as soon as possible. Also you can make your own contributions. See github.com/ahmdrz/goinsta/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md
