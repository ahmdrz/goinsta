/*
Package goinsta implements Goinsta private API in Golang.
We changed the API for the comfort of the user.
The new API is object-oriented making the programming bot task less repetitive.

Probably you will find this API a bit confusing.
This API is a little representation of Instagram engineers work.
We are trying to humanize it. Do not care.
If you have any question you can open an issue.

Currently the API is uncomplete (we did it in a week xd).
If you see that Goinsta needs any method or any new feature you are free to open
an issue in github.com/ahmdrz/goinsta we will work to solve your issue as soon
as possible. Also you can make your own contributions.
